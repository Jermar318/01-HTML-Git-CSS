## Description

The Website provided worked for the most part, just needed code to be cleaned up.
- Other the syntax of the stylesheet, the only change you can visually see is to adjust the font of the body of the index.


### Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

'''
